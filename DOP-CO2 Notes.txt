What is ec2:
“EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) AWS used to run applications virtual servers in the cloud. You can choose instance types, operating systems, storage, and networking, and pay-as-you-go pricing model.

VPC:
A VPC is a private network in AWS where we deploy our resources. In my projects, I usually create a dedicated VPC for each environment (dev, staging, prod).
Public subnet → Internet access (through IGW)
Private subnet → no direct Internet access, used for like databases.
IGW->An Internet Gateway connects the VPC to the Internet. Without IGW, resources in VPC cannot communicate with the Internet.
RT->Route tables decide where network traffic should go. I configure default routes for public subnets to IGW, and private subnets to NAT Gateway.
SG->Security Groups firewalls instance level. I usually allow only required ports, for example, specific ports used by our applications developers.
NG->NAT Gateway instances allow in a private subnet to the Internet access.
Elastic IP->An Elastic IP is a static public IPv4 address in AWS that can be attached to resources like EC2 or NAT Gateway.

ALB:
ALB->In my projects, we use ALB to handle web application traffic. For example
I have deploy EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
The ALB sits in frontend receives all the client requests (on HTTP/HTTPS).
then routes the traffic to healthy EC2 instances using target groups.
ALB supports path-based and host-based routing. For example,
/api/* → goes to backend service target group
/images/* → goes to image service target group
Health checks are configured, so if one EC2 instance is unhealthy, traffic is automatically sent to healthy instances.
We also integrate SSL certificates with ALB to provide HTTPS.
